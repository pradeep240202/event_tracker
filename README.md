            }



GET /api/events/<id>/: Get a specific event.

    Response:
        {
            "id": 1,

        }


Notes
SQLite is used in this project for simplicity and to save time. While PostgreSQL would be more suitable for a production-level application, SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that requires minimal setup, making it ideal for quick assessments and development.

Redis is used for Celeryâ€™s task processing.

Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring a consistent environment.
